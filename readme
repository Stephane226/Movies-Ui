MOVIES FETCHING APP WITH JAVASCRIPT

My project is about creating an Ui that can fetch an API and return movies information.
Also being able to use a user's search value in the input field to return movies related to that search value. 
you can check my codes and any suggestion from you will be a pleasure . 
THANK YOU ;)
